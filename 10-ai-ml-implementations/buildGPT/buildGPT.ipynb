    "### Notes on Attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attention is a communication mechanism. \n",
    "    * Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph, where each node has some vector of information\n",
    "    * Nodes are looking at each other (edges pointing at each other) \n",
    "    * Each node aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to it, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "* There is no notion of space. Attention (by default) simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens. The `pos_emb` object is what gives self-attention the notion of space\n",
    "    * *I.e. Nodes don't know \"where they are positioned in space\". Attention is just a set of vectors randomly in space which communicate*\n",
    "* Each of the $\\text{B}$ batches are processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
    "    * A **batched matrix multiply** is what applies a matrix multiplication **in parallel across the batch dimension**\n",
    "        * This is why (B, T, 16) @ (B, 16, T) ---> (B, T, T)\n",
    "        * It's essentially doing $\\text{B}$ 2-D matrix multiplications in parallel. This is a CPU efficiency measure.\n",
    "* In an **\"encoder\" block of (self-)attention** just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. \n",
    "    * That's the general case: e.g. for sentiment analysis w/ transformer, all tokens can freely speak w/ each other to predict the sentiment of the whole sentence\n",
    "    * This block here is called a **\"decoder\" (self-)attention block** because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modelling.\n",
    "    * **Attention supports arbitrary connectivity between nodes!** Attention doesn't care if you use encoder or decoder blocks.\n",
    "* \"Self-attention\" just means that the **keys** `k`'s and **values** `v`'s are produced from the same source as **queries** `q`'s. \n",
    "    * This source is the initial input vector `x`, which contains $\\text{T}$ tokens, each emitting a `k`, `q`, and `v`.\n",
    "    * In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from `x`, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "        * I.e. a separate set of nodes from which will pull information into our nodes\n",
    "* \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `weights` by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\texttt{head\\_size}}}$. An important normalisation!\n",
    "    * Softmax function can be sensitive to very large input values. These kill the gradient, and slow down learning, or cause it to stop altogether\n",
    "    * This makes it so when input `q`, `k` are unit variance (Gaussian: $\\mu=0$, and $\\sigma=1$), `weights` will be unit variance ($\\sigma=1$) too \n",
    "    * and so when `weights` feeds into Softmax step (see above), it will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below"
