    "- A last example is the experiment where you toss a die. You can toss the die multiple times and all of these throws can have different outcomes: 6 to be exact, since your die has 6 numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6). An event \"The sum of the results of the two toss is equal to 10\" can consist of 10, while the event \"the number is even\" can consist of 2, 4, or 6.\n",
    "- A somewhat cliché example would be flipping a coin. In this case, the experiment is, in fact, the flipping of a coin. You can toss the coin multiple times, and all these trials might have different outcomes. As there are two possible outcomes -heads or tails- the sample space is 2. However, the event \"tossing a coin\" can, for example, consist of one outcome \"Heads\". Similarly, when you toss a coin twice, your event \"the first toss results in a Heads\" might have an outcome \"Heads-Heads\" or \"Heads-Tails\".\n",
    "- Another example that is maybe less straightforward is an experiment where you spin a globe and you stop it by putting your finger on it. You can spin the globe multiple times and all these times might have different outcomes - You can either land your finger on land or on water. That means that the sample space is 2. An event \"my finger is on land\" might have an outcome \"Land - Water\" or \"Land - Land\"."
